# simpleptt 1.2

This program is simply a version of Simpleptt 1.1 from here (http://dp.nonoo.hu/projects/simpleptt/) compiled using VC++ 2017 targeting Windows XP and above.  This allows it to run on modern Windows OS like Windows 10 and 11 where as the version 1.1 was difficult if not impossible to install because the needed VC++ libraries were not available to install on Windows 10/11

The only other change is that I set it to not launch to the system tray upon startup.

I'm not a huge VC++ programmer so pull requests may be made but unless they compile on the first try they probably won't be accepted unless it's a simple fix.
